      <!-- Prop Questions & Submissions -->
      <h2 class="text-xl pb-4" id="submissions">Prop Questions & Submissions</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4 pb-4">
        <li>
          The prop bets change each week and users are required to answer all prop questions during the week. Prop questions are designed by the Bet Pirate team
          each week and are not tied to any other platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          In order for your submission to be eligible for that week answers must be input and payment made prior to the Sunday 1pm deadline for that week.
        </li>
        <li>You cannot edit your submissions once they are submitted.</li>
        <li>
          If you want to make multiple submissions you will need to use a different email address. This email will be used to track the leader board results for
          the monthly and season long prizes. Read more about them below.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Payments & Awards -->
      <h2 class="text-xl pb-4" id="awards">Payments & Awards</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4 pb-4">
        <li>Payment is completed using a valid credit card number and processed through a third party platform called Stripe.</li>
        <li>
          Each week the user (or users) with the most correct answers will be awarded a percentage of the pot.
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
            <li>50% of each week’s pot go towards that week’s winner.</li>
            <li>20% of the pot will go towards a monthly pot where the user (or users) with the most correct guesses in the month will receive a payout.</li>
            <li>
              10% of the pot will go towards a season long winner, where the user (or users) with the most correct guesses in the season will receive a payout.
            </li>
            <li>The remaining 20% will go to platform fees.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          In the event there are multiple winners of a week, month or season the payout will be divided by the number of those winners. Example: if the weekly
          pot is $500 and two users had the same number of correct guesses they would split the pot evenly, $250 each.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payments to the winner will be made by e-transfer to the email on file. Failure to provide an accurate email or accept the e-transfer before the
          transfer deadline may result in payments not being successful.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Stat Corrections -->
      <h2 class="text-xl pb-4" id="corrections">Stat Corrections</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4 pb-4">
        <li>
          Props may become subject to stat corrections. For instance, if there is a prop that asks will player X have over or under 100.5 rushing yards this
          week and their stat line changes based on the NFL statistics board the answer for that prop may change. An example is if the player catches a pass
          that is thrown backwards and gains 10 yards that statistic may originally be considered a reception and not rushing yards but because it is a
          backwards pass that ruling would change the player’s stat line to 10 additional rushing yards. These stat corrections are not always picked up right
          away and may result in changes to the users score.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Props that Push or Miss -->
      <h2 class="text-xl pb-4" id="xxxxx">Props that Push or Miss</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4 pb-4">
        <li>
          If a prop does not have a clear correct answer or winner the prop will be considered a push or void. Meaning no one will receive a correct answer for
          that prop. An example would be to pick the winner of an NFL game but the game ends in a tie. In this case no user will receive a point for a correct
          submission so the prop becomes void.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a match is interrupted but subsequently resumed and played to a finish within 48 hours of the original match time, bets will stand for that week.
          An example would be a thunderstorm rain delay. If the match is played within 48 hours of the interruption, that game and the props will be considered.
          However, if match is delayed beyond the 48 hour time frame the bet will be considered a push and all entries will be voided for that specific prop. An
          example would be COVID causes the game to be rescheduled. No user would receive a point for their submission.
        </li>
